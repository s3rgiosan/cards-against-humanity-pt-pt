# How to contribute

Everyone is welcome to contribute with translations in Portuguese, from Portugal.

## Getting Started
* Make sure you have a [GitHub](https://github.com/join) account.
* Submit an issue with a translation for a question or an answer, assuming one does not already exist.
  * Clearly name the issue with the original question or answer.
  * Use the comment section to indicate the possible translation, or, if in doubt, a set translations.
* After public discussion and voting (use the :+1: and :-1: reactions), the project maintainers will then merge your translation.

## Notes
Take note that in the majority of cases there's not a direct translation, mainly because most of the questions and answers are country specific.

So we are hoping that you can help us find the right translations with the right context and meaning for the Portuguese community.

## License

By contributing with your translations, you agree to license your contribution under the same project license.
